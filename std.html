            <span class="label">Why are you interested in this specific lab/research area?:</span>
            <span class="value">Dr. Blaine Andrew Christiansen’s research interests closely align with the goals of the lab I am currently working in, which is why I find his lab particularly appealing. His recent work on fractures and ACL injuries is something I am already familiar with. What stands out to me is Dr. Christiansen’s ability to effectively integrate clinical research with academic work. It would be an invaluable experience to engage with clinical settings alongside research, particularly in the field of orthopedics. Additionally, I have noticed that some of Dr. Christiansen’s research interests are focused on mechanobiology. This is an area I have been curious about for some time, as I specialize in biomechanics. While the two fields are not identical, this overlap is exactly why I am eager to explore a related area of research. I am confident that in Dr. Christiansen’s lab, I would have the opportunity to deepen my understanding of the bone system beyond what I have learned in my current lab.

            <span class="label">The experience you have had related to this research topic (classes you have taken, research you have done, projects you have worked on):</span>
            <span class="value">The name of my lab is the Applied Biomechanics for Tissue Regeneration, where the primary research focuses on skeletal system regeneration, osteoarthritis, and animal models related to bone or cartilage defects and aging. Biomechanics is the central area of study in my lab, and I am well-acquainted with mechanical loading on small animals. I have also gained experience with several animal models, such as ACLT, DMM, LSI, and ACLR, although I am not yet capable of independently performing all of them. My independent project centers on mouse intervertebral disc degeneration, which involves creating the lumbar spine instability (LSI) model, an area I am experienced in. I believe LSI, as an aging model, aligns closely with Dr. Christiansen’s research interests. Moreover, I have developed a solid foundation in bone, cartilage, osteoarthritis (OA), and aging in the intervertebral disc (IVD), which I believe will allow me to integrate quickly into Dr. Christiansen’s lab.
